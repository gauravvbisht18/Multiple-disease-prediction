<b>Multiple Disease Prediction App:</b>

Iâ€™ve developed an application that predicts diseases like diabetes and heart disease based on user input. Using a combination of machine learning algorithmsâ€”such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machine model â€”the app provides personalized risk assessments. Itâ€™s hosted on Streamlit, ensuring a user-friendly experience. Letâ€™s empower users to take charge of their health! ðŸŒŸ
